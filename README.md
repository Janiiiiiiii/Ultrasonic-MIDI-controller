# Ultrasonic-MIDI-controller
This project is a MIDI controller that can change notes by changing the distance from the ultrasonic sensor.
There is a chromatic scale MIDI contoller which is hard to control.
The c scale project gives out full Cmaj scale of one octave.
The last project is a toy that needs a buzzer that can change notes and create music accordingly.

Thank You for reading.
